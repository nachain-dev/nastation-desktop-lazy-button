# vaadin-lazy-download-button
A component that allows creating content to download in the background without blocking the UI thread.



The lazy download button is a normal Vaadin button, that utilizes an anchor to download
a server side file once the server side work to obtain it is done. This allows to keep the UI interactive
while the download is prepared.
